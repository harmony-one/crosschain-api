# Testing the API

In order to test the API, you need to complete the following checklist:

* Get tokens
* Make sure that there is enough liquidity in the BSUD/bscBUSD pool in Viper and/or add liquidity
* Start the webserver
* Try the examples in this folder!

## Getting tokens

* You need the following tokens:
    - BUSD in the Ethereum Kovan testnet
    - Harmony's ONE tokens (for paying gas)
    - Harmony's BUSD and bscBUSD for adding liquidity

### Getting BUSD in the Ethereum Kovan testnet

* You can get these tokens from (Harmony's Horizon Bridge Faucet)[https://testnet.bridge.hmny.io/get-tokens]

### Getting Harmony's ONE token

* You can get these tokens from the (Harmony testnet faucet)[https://faucet.pops.one/]

### Getting Harmony's BUSD and bscBUSD bridged tokens

* For getting Harmony's BUSD you need to bridge from Ethereum BUSD using (Harmony's Horizon Bridge)[https://testnet.bridge.hmny.io/busd]

* For getting Harmony's bscBUSD you need to bridge from Harmony's BUSD using (ViperSwap)[https://viperswap.one/#/swap]
